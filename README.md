# Sword-Fighter

# ABSTRACT

This project is about a 2d side scroller developed using the Unity Game Engine. A side-scrolling game or side-scroller is a video game in which the gameplay action is viewed from a side-view camera angle, and as the player&#39;s character moves left or right, the screen scrolls with them. These games make use of scrolling computer display technology. A common use of the side-scrolling format is in the platform game genre. Platform games are action games that feature jumping, climbing, and running through many diverse levels. _Super Mario Bros._ (1985) is among the most famous side-scrollers of this type. For the most part, the screen of a side-scrolling video game follows the player character and tries to keep it near the center of the screen. Other games will adjust the screen with the character&#39;s movement, making the character off-center in the opposite direction of its movement, showing more space in front of the character than behind. A game can use the side-scrolling mechanic without being considered a side-scrolling game.

The games include assets. Game assets include everything that can go into a game, including 2D models, sprites, sound effects, music, code snippets and modules, and even complete projects that can be used by a game engine.

Talking about the Unity Game Engine. Unity also does a lot of things the &quot;hard way&quot; when it comes to 2D game development, which doesn&#39;t _feel _native compared to other game engines.  Creating a 2D game world in Unity, for example, feels like shoehorning a 2D plane into a large 3D space, and things like animation and pixel perfection are more clunky than in other 2D-specific engines.

# Problem Statement

Make a 2d game using the Unity Engine. 2d games are easy to build but difficult to make them as good as possible. As there are only some of the things which the user experience during the game. The gameplay should be as simple as possible and appealing to the user. In 3d games graphics, lighting, VFX are there which make the game attracting but we can&#39;t do these things in 2d games. So, the developer needs to make the best out of the small things. In this 2d game the camera follows the player so the game is needed to be free of parallax. The UI of the game should be easy to understand.
